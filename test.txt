$ git status 

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        test.txt


 why untracked test.txt?
github  folder (git-file.txt) => clone in local() =>
              2 sections (after clone we get 2 copy )
                     1.git folder
                     2.working  folder 


now , working folder created(test.txt) so untracking file
todo> test.text >> put in git folder >> put in github folder

to make test.txt as tracked file 
$ git add test.txt
